# CS 141 – Intro to Computer Science (Java)

This repository contains selected projects from **CS 141** at **Knox College**, completed during my first term of computer science.  
These assignments demonstrate early experience with Java programming, object-oriented design, loops, conditionals, data processing, and interactive graphics.

**Files included:**
- `Circle.java`
- `CoolPattern.java`
- `Face.java`
- `Spiral.java`
- `StickFig.java`
- `Vehicle.java`

## 🚩 Flagmaker
A flag-generation program built using a provided skeleton.

**Skills practiced:**
- Working with starter code and Java frameworks
- Drawing shapes using coordinate-based logic
- Translating specifications into programmatic graphics

**Files included:**
- `Main.java`
- `Lab03FlagMaker.java`

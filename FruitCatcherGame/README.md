# Fruit Catcher Game (Java, Greenfoot)

This project is a simple arcade-style **Fruit Catcher game** developed using **Java** and the **Greenfoot** framework.  
The player controls a bucket to catch falling fruits while avoiding missed catches that end the game.

## 🎮 Game Overview

- Fruits fall from the top of the screen at random positions.
- The player moves a bucket left and right to catch the fruits.
- Each successful catch increases the score.
- Missing a fruit results in a game-over condition.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

- Random fruit spawning
- Player-controlled bucket movement with screen boundaries
- Collision detection between bucket and fruits
- Score tracking
- Game-over logic when a fruit is missed
- Use of image assets (PNG) for game objects
